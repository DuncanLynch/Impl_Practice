# What is this repo?
This is all of my C++ implementations of common structures and systems. In the future I will be implementing design patterns, and even futher in the future, I will be implementing more complex structures, like async event loops, tasks, and coroutines. 

# What is the point?
C++ does not have a unified package manager, and I like to learn by doing, so, my solution is to create implementations of things that I can lean on in the future.
